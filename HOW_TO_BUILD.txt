To build and test the plugin in a server (Windows), follow the following instructions.

Make sure your server is running Spigot or Paper.

1. Copy "build.bat" into your Minecraft server directory (which contains the "plugins" directory).
2. Open the server's directory in the command line (right-click and choose "Open in Terminal" context menu item).
3. Run the following command:

.\build.bat "jdk_path"

Replace jdk_path (keep quotations) with the directory to your JDK, for example:
C:\Users\username\.jdks\corretto-17.0.7\

4. When done, the live plugin jar is in your server's plugins directory.
